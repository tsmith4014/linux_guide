# Guide to Automating Common Jira Tasks

Automating repetitive tasks in Jira (pronounced “Jeera”) can greatly enhance workflow efficiency, freeing up time for more critical tasks. Below is a step-by-step guide for automating common Jira tickets, from basic setup to advanced automation techniques.

## Step-by-Step Workflow for Automating Jira Tickets

### 1. Familiarize Yourself with Jira

Before diving into automation, ensure you're comfortable with Jira's interface and key features. Areas to focus on include:

- **Dashboards**: Track the progress of tickets and overall team performance.
- **Projects and Boards**: Organize and view tickets (issues) by project and workflow.
- **Issue Types**: Understand the different types of tickets (e.g., Bug, Task, Story, Epic).
- **Workflows**: Familiarize yourself with how issues progress from creation to resolution.
- **Automation Rules**: Jira has powerful built-in automation that helps streamline repetitive tasks.

> **Tip**: If your company has a pre-configured Jira setup, request documentation from your team that outlines any Jira-specific workflows or standards they follow.

### 2. Identify Common Ticket Patterns

Review historical tickets to find repetitive issues that can benefit from automation. Common candidates for automation include:

- **Support Requests**: Password resets, account provisioning, etc.
- **Recurring Reports**: Monthly/quarterly reports.
- **Standardized Bug Reports**: Repeated patterns for bug tracking.

For each identified ticket, note:

- **Ticket type**: Bug, Task, Story, Epic, etc.
- **Common fields**: Priority, assignee, components, labels.
- **Actions taken**: Standard steps used to resolve the ticket.

**Example**: If you notice each new employee onboarding follows the same subtasks (create accounts, set permissions, etc.), it is a prime candidate for automation.

### 3. Start Using Jira Automation

Jira's built-in automation rules allow you to automate actions based on triggers, conditions, and responses. These automations can be accessed via **Project Settings > Automation**.

#### Basic Automation Setup:

- **Trigger**: What initiates the automation (e.g., ticket creation, status change).
- **Condition**: Criteria the issue must meet to trigger the action (e.g., issue type is “Bug”).
- **Action**: The task Jira performs automatically (e.g., assign ticket, add a comment, transition issue).

### 4. Automating Common Tickets

Here is a sample workflow for automating user account creation tickets, which is a typical task in IT support.

#### Workflow Example: Automating User Account Creation Tickets

**Step 1**: Identify common subtasks.

- Analyze the typical steps taken during user onboarding (e.g., create accounts, assign roles, send login info).

**Step 2**: Create a ticket template.

- Create an issue template specifically for onboarding tasks, including:
  - **Summary**: “New User Onboarding – [User Name]”
  - **Description**: Steps for account creation and setup.
  - **Subtasks**:
    - “Create account in system A.”
    - “Assign necessary permissions.”
    - “Send user login credentials.”

**Step 3**: Automate ticket creation and assignment.

- Go to **Project Settings > Automation** and set up a new rule:
  - **Trigger**: When an issue of type “Task” is created.
  - **Condition**: Ensure the issue is categorized as “User Onboarding.”
  - **Action**:
    - Create subtasks for each onboarding step.
    - Assign tasks to the appropriate team members.
    - Set a due date for each task.
    - Add a comment: “Onboarding process initiated for [User Name].”

**Example Rule**:

- **Trigger**: Issue created (type = Task, summary contains “User Onboarding”).
- **Condition**: Project = IT Support, Priority = Medium.
- **Actions**:
  - Create subtasks (e.g., “Create account in system A”).
  - Assign tasks to the appropriate IT staff.
  - Set the due date for 3 business days.
  - Add a comment: “User onboarding process initiated.”
  - Notify team members via email.

### 5. Set Up Notifications & Escalations

You can also automate notifications or escalate tickets when they remain unresolved. This is helpful for improving accountability.

**Example Escalation Rule**:

- **Trigger**: An issue’s due date is approaching (e.g., within 2 days).
- **Condition**: The status is still “Open” or “In Progress.”
- **Action**:
  - Send a notification to the assignee and team lead.
  - Escalate the ticket by increasing its priority or reassigning it.

### 6. Track & Refine Automations

Once your automation rules are live, monitor their performance:

- Use Jira’s **dashboards** and **reports** to track how tickets flow through the system.
- Review team feedback and ticket resolution times to gauge if automation is speeding things up.
- Regularly refine your automations to adapt to changes in the workflow or team structure.

### 7. Advanced Automation Ideas

As you gain confidence, explore more complex automation options:

- **Linking related tickets**: Automatically link issues that are dependent on or related to each other (e.g., a development task linked to a bug report).
- **Custom scripts**: For more advanced needs, Jira’s ScriptRunner plugin allows you to write custom automation scripts.
- **Service Desk Automations**: Automate common IT service requests, like password resets or granting system permissions.

### 8. Document Your Automation Processes

Documentation is key for ensuring that your automations can be maintained and improved by others on your team:

- Maintain a **Confluence** or **wiki** page that details the automations you’ve set up.
- Clearly outline:
  - Trigger events.
  - Conditions that must be met.
  - Actions that the automation takes.

### 9. Seek Feedback

Once your automations are running, solicit feedback from your team and management:

- Are the automations improving ticket handling time?
- Are there any unforeseen issues or areas where automations could be enhanced?
- Are additional automations needed for other tasks?

## Sample Automation Rule

Here’s what a basic automation rule might look like in Jira’s rule builder for user onboarding:

**Rule Name**: Automate User Onboarding Tickets

- **Trigger**: Issue created (Issue Type = Task).
- **Condition**:
  - If "Summary" contains "User Onboarding".
- **Actions**:
  - Create sub-tasks (e.g., "Create account in system A", "Assign permissions").
  - Assign subtasks to team members.
  - Set due date to 3 business days from ticket creation.
  - Add a comment: “The user onboarding process has started.”
  - Notify assigned team members via email.

## Final Notes

- Jira’s built-in automation capabilities will handle most common use cases. For more advanced requirements, plugins like **ScriptRunner** or **Automation for Jira** can add flexibility.
- Keep your automation efforts well-documented so that your team can easily follow and improve the processes over time.
